# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for various computer vision tasks. CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that have proven to be highly effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

## Features
- **Image Classification:** Implementations of CNNs for image classification tasks.
- **Object Detection:** CNN models for detecting objects in images.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Code for training and evaluating the CNN models on custom datasets.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained CNN models for quick deployment or transfer learning.
